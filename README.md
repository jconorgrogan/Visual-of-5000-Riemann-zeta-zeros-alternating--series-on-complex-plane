This project explores a new geometric perspective on the Riemann zeta function by visualizing the paths of partial sums at nontrivial zeros.

## Key Ideas

- **Two-scale identity**  
  For each prime \(p\), the masked partial sums can be written as a difference between two scales, producing a “prime lens” on the dynamics.

- **Prime rings**  
  On the critical line, each prime \(p\) induces a neutral annulus at radius \(\sqrt{p}\).  
  The paths of zeta zeros visibly hover near these rings before collapsing, while off the line the radius drifts to \(p^{\,1-\sigma}\).

- **Finite-window statistics**  
  By normalizing over geometric windows, one can define a **ring score** that distinguishes true zeros (which show stationary ring mass and phase precession) from non-zeros.

- **Tomographic potential**  
  Radii encode \(\Re(s)\), precession encodes \(t\), and stationarity occurs only on \(\Re(s)=\tfrac12\).  
  This suggests a possible finite-data diagnostic for zeta zeros.
