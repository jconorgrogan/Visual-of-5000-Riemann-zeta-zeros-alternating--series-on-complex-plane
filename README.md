# Visual-of-5000-Riemann-zeta-zeros-alternating--series-on-complex-plane

A (to my knowledge) unique/novel way of visualizing the zeta zeros 

To use: download HTML locally and run. You can also visualize in 3d

<img width="480" height="954" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6268d77-71cf-4509-8c1d-f512be9cdeae" />

<img width="697" height="683" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c671482-fbfd-49a8-9c8a-062e60ff855d" />

To-do:
Explain why sqrt(2) rings form in the visualization
Conjecture about the "speeds" of the zeros as they "fall" down the sqrt circles in the animation
