# Visual-of-5000-Riemann-zeta-zeros-alternating--series-on-complex-plane

A (to my knowledge) unique/novel way of visualizing the zeta zeros 

To use: download HTML locally and run. You can also visualize in 3d

To-do:
Explain why sqrt(2) rings form in the visualization
Conjecture about the "speeds" of the zeros as they "fall" down the sqrt circles in the animation
